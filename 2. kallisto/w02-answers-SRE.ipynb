This is not much different than doing experimental controls, where your positive control is often an easier experiment with well-defined, well-known reagents and inputs. Just because your positive control worked, doesn't mean your experiment worked; but if your positive control failed, you should worry.\n",

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "A little puzzling, actually! De-circularizing the Arc locus fixed Arc1 but not Arc6, so it's not solely a matter of circularization. Removing all overlaps (so all reads uniquely map) fixes the problem completely, but of course it does; it makes the problem trivial, and the whole point of kallisto is to infer transcript abundances even when transcripts overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've run this problem every year that MCB112 has been taught and it's still not clear what's going on. And new versions of kallisto continue to show the same behavior. The best solution that I've seen was contributed by Will Mallard, one of the TFs in 2017. You can [download his pset solution .ipynb file from 2017](http://mcb112.org/w02/w02-answers-WM.ipynb). Will's experiments show that for _low abundance_ transcripts, kallisto needs _at least one piece of that transcript to be unique_ (i.e. reads map uniquely to it). De-circularization, in Will's view, is a red herring; what also happens when we decircularize is that the A segment becomes unique to Arc1, and kallisto accurately quantitates Arc1. When he did simulations where he removes overlaps from the start of Arc6, kallisto accurately quantitates Arc6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, there's no reason (mathematically) why kallisto should have a problem with the overlaps, even though our Arc locus is a pretty pathological case... and it's puzzling that it only has a problem with quantitating low-abundance transcripts. But Will's dissection is the best so far."
